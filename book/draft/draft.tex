	You can use this template to
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Draft a module.
		\item Test-drive some figures.
		\item Play with colors!

	You can write definitions:

		A \emph{bird} that is also a \emph{turtle}.
	\end{definition}

	Module 1

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Internalize vectors as geometric objects representing displacements.

		\item Use column vector notation to write vectors.

		\item Relate points and vectors and be able to interpret a point as
			a vector and a vector as a point.

		\item Solve simple equations involving vectors.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation} Students have differing levels of experience with vectors.
	We want to establish a common notation for vectors and use vector notation
	along with algebra to solve simple questions. E.g., ``How can I get to location
	$A$ given that I can only walk parallel to the lines $y=4x$ and $y=-x$?''


	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item
			We will use the language \emph{component of $\vec v$ in
			the direction $\vec u$} in the future and it will be a \emph{vector}.
			For this reason, try to refer to the entries of a column
			vector as \emph{coordinates} or \emph{entries} instead of components.

			\item
			Though we will almost exclusively use
			column vector notation in this course, students should be able to parse
			questions phrased in terms of row vectors.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}We will use column vector notation and the idea of equating
	coordinates in order to solve problems.

		\Goal{Hands-on experience with vectors as displacements.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Internalize vectors as geometric objects representing
				displacements.

			\item Use column vector notation to write vectors.

			\item Use pre-existing knowledge of algebra to answer vector
				questions.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{goals}
	\begin{notes}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item There are many ways to solve this problem.
				Some students
				might start with equations. After they use their
				equations to solve the problem, make them draw a picture
				and come up with a graphical solution.

			\item When the students start coming up with vector equations,
				give them the vocabulary of \emph{linear
				combinations}
				and \emph{column vector notation}.

You are a young adventurer. Having spent most of your time in the mythical city of Oronto,
	you decide to leave home for the first time. Your parents
want to help you on your journey, so just before your departure, they give you two
gifts. Specifically, they give you two forms of transportation: a hover board and
a magic carpet. Your parents inform you that both the hover board and the magic carpet
have restrictions in how they operate:

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/HoverBoard-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the hover board's movement by the vector
	$\mat{3 \\1}$. By this we mean that if
	the hover board traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 3 km East and
	1 km North of its starting location.
\end{minipage}

	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/MagicCarpet-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the magic carpet's movement by the vector
	$\mat{1 \\2 }$. By this we mean that if the
	magic carpet traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 1 km East and
	2 km North of its starting location.

% Scenario Section
\textbf{Scenario One: The Maiden Voyage}

Your Uncle Cramer suggests that your first adventure should be to go visit
the wise man, Old Man Gauss. Uncle Cramer tells you that Old Man Gauss
lives in a cabin that is 107 km East and 64 km North of your home.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Task:}
\par
Investigate whether or not you can use the hover board and the magic
carpet to get to Gauss's cabin. If so, how? If it is not possible to
get to the cabin with these modes of transportation, why is that the case?

%\vspace{5mm}
% As a group, state and explain your answer(s) on the group whiteboard. Use
% the vector notation for each mode of transportation as part of your
% explanation and use a diagram or graphic to help illustrate your
% point(s).
